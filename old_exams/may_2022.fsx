(*------------------------------Question 1------------------------------*)
//type declaration for question 1
type TrashItem<'a> =
    | Paper of string
    | Glass of string
    | Other of 'a


//1.1
//example types
let item1 = Other ("Shirt", "Clothes")
let item2 = Paper "Newspaper"
let item3 = Other ("Sneakers", "Shoe")
let item4 = Glass "Wine glass"

(* 
type of item1 is TrashItem<string * string> 
In the type declaration Other can be anything of a TrashItem, 
so since we in this case give it a tuple of strings,
the type is a TrashItem of a tuple of Strings
*)

(*
type of item2 is TrashItem<'a>, because the type cannot be inferred from 
the information given. A trashitem of a string could either be glass or paper.
*)

(* 
The TrashItem type is polymorphic because it can be either a string or anything else
depending on whether it is Paper/Glass or Other
*)

let items = [Paper("Magasine"); Glass("Bottle"); Glass("Jam"); Other("Beer can", "Aluminium"); Other("Bag", "Plastic")]

//tests. Output correctly ðŸ˜Ž
ppTrashItem fnPP item1
ppTrashItem fnPP item2
ppTrashItem fnPP item4

// in F# land, it is because elemB was made as a linkElem with elemA as its next node

//3.1
let rec f x = function
    [] -> []
    |y::ys when x=y -> f x ys
    |y::ys when x <> y ->
        match f x ys with
        ys' -> y::ys'


(*
type for f is:  'a -> 'a list -> 'a list when 'a: equality
f removes all x's from a list y
*)

//examples:
f 1 [1; 1; 2;3]
f 2 [1;2;3]
f 3 [1;2;3]

//appropriate name could be removeX, since it removes x's from a list

//3.2
(*
The pattern match warning comes from the 'match' expression because it is matching against
a function, not a constructor or wildcard. 
*)

// f is not tail-recursive because the recursive calls with the cons (::) operator would build up the stack

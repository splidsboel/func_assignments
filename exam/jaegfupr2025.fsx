The type of ex2 is mapStack<string, char> because the tuples consist of a string and a list of chars.
The type declaration of MapStack specifies that the 'a type is the first value in the tuple and the 'b
type is what is in the stack (or list)*)

The "when 'a: equality" constraint in the type means that the argument given for k
and the first element in the tuple in the list given as argument for l must be comparable.
This is because they need to be compared to make decision to remove them or not
